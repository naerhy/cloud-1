## Usage

### Secrets file

The `secrets.yaml` file holds all the sensitive data about the host provider.  
The password is only known by members of this project, and is required in order to launch the ansible playbooks.  
It holds the following values:
- host (ip)
- user
- password
- domain_name

You can generate a new file with a new password in case you have to update these values.
